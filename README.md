# CS114_Week6_GithubAssignment
A public repository for the Week 6 CS114 website creation using github project.

While we have used word documents to represent webpages, we have tried to best demonstrate the structure of our website (North Grammar School) using folders. 
If still unsure of the structure we were going for, users can find a diagram in the Design Folder. 

This website was worked on by Aidan, Bo and Eve.
